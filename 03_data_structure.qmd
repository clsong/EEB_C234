# Data Structure

A **data structure** is essentially an organized way to store and access data efficiently. In R, there are many data structures. For the majority of data wrangling, ther are two core data structures, `vector` and `tibble`.

Mastering data structures are usually the most challenging part of any programming language, especially if you already have some basics in programming.

## Vector
A **vector** is a one-dimensional array that can hold numeric, character, or logical data. In R, you can create a vector using the `c()` function. For example, to create a vector of numbers from 1 to 5, you can use the following code:
```{r}
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
numbers
```

## Tibble
Tibble is 

We will deal with importing datasets later. For now, we will use the `penguins` dataset from the `palmerpenguins` package.

## Our dataset: `penguins`
We will use a dataset called `penguins` from the `palmerpenguins` package. We will use this dataset throughout our course. This dataset contains measurements of penguins collected from three species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

First things first, let us load the `penguins` dataset.
```{r}
# install.packages("palmerpenguins")   # <1>
library(palmerpenguins) # <2>
data(package = "palmerpenguins") # <3>
```
1. If you have not installed the `palmerpenguins` package, you can install it by uncommenting this line.
2. Load the `palmerpenguins` package.
3. Load the `penguins` dataset.

As a first rule, always, always take a look at your data. One way is just to display the data.
```{r}
penguins # <1>
``` 
1. Display the `penguins` dataset.

The data format we are using is called `tibble`. It is a modern version of the `data.frame` in R. It is part of the `tidyverse` package. For most of your daily works, tibble is the only two formats (the other is vector) you need to know.

However, if you want to see the data in a more structured way, you can use the `skim()` function in the package `skimr`.
```{r}
pacman::p_load(skimr) # <1>
skim(penguins) # <2>
```
1. Load the `skimr` package.
2. Display the summary of the `penguins` dataset.
