    "text": "1.1 Why Bother with This Course in the Age of AI?\nAlright, let’s cut to the chase. You signed up to study Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, not Computer Science. You probably envision yourself out in the field, knee-deep in mud, observing the subtle interactions of ecosystems—not stuck behind a screen, wrestling with semicolons and syntax errors. And now, with these fancy new AI tools that seem to do everything but your taxes, you might be wondering: why bother learning this computational stuff at all? Can’t a chatbot handle it all—generate analyses, whip up some plots, and call it a day?\nIt’s a fair question. Technology is reshaping everything, and science is no exception. But here’s the thing: just as biologists in the past had to master the microscope, today’s biologists need a strong foundation in computing. This course isn’t about turning you into a programmer; it’s about giving you the keys to harness technology effectively—so you’re steering the ship, not just along for the ride.\nBefore any anxiety sets in, let me assure you that this course is not gonna be a sink-or-swim experience. We’ll embark on a guided journey into computing, building your skills step by step. Think of it as learning a new language—with much simpler grammar, thankfully. We’ll use concrete example with annotated codes and hands-on exercises to support you along the way.\nAnd about those AI tools? Yes, they can be incredibly useful, no doubt. But relying on them blindly, without understanding the underlying principles, is like cooking from a recipe in a language you barely know. Sure, you might finish the dish, but there’s a good chance you’ll miss something critical—maybe misinterpret a step, add the wrong ingredient, or be puzzled by the end result. Computational literacy helps you to catch when the AI is leading you astray, saving you from headaches (and potentially flawed results) down the line.\nI get the temptation of the “easy button”, we all do. But investing in these skills now will pay off many times over. You’ll be a more efficient, more confident researcher—and, frankly, it will boost your chances of publishing in those coveted high-profile journals.",

    "section": "\n1.2 What You’ll Learn",
    "text": "1.2 What You’ll Learn\nWe’ll cover the following topics, which are, in my view, the most essential computing skills for ecologists today. These are the things I wish I knew when I started grad school – it would have saved me so much time and frustration!\n\n1.2.1 Fluency with R\nWhat is our weapon of choice in this course? The R programming language. It is not the most well-polished language. It is not the fastest language. It is not the most user-friendly language. So, why R? Well, it is the lingua franca in our community. The computational tools in ecology are largely R-based. So, if you want to tap into this wealth, you’ll need a working knowledge of R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling Adventurous?\n\n\n\n\n\nNot sold on R? You could try Julia, a newer language that’s faster, more elegant, and gaining popularity. The syntax is similar enough to R to make it a relatively easy transition, and it can even load R packages, so you can have the best of both worlds.\n\n\n\nR has also evolved dramatically in the past decade with the rise of the tidyverse suite. When I started grad school, I absolutely hated using R. But the tidyverse transformed that experience. It introduced a coherent way of handling and visualizing data—one that feels logical and intuitive. I firmly believe it’s the right approach to data manipulation and plotting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeroes Behind the Tidyverse\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse revolution is largely thanks to Hadley Wickham, whose contributions earned him the COPSS Presidents’ Award, the top honor in statistics.\nBut it’s not a one-person show—the tidyverse thrives because of a vibrant community united by a shared vision (link).\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Crafting Publication-Ready Figures\nWith ggplot2, you’ll learn the Grammar of Graphics, one of the most powerful plotting systems out there. Beyond just producing high-quality figures, it will teach you a structured approach to data visualization.\nWhile ggplot2 is powerful, its defaults aren’t always perfect. We’ll cover design principles that enhance both the appeal and informativeness of your figures. This skill is quite useful—after all, figures often make the first impression on your readers. By the end of the course, you’ll be capable of creating figures like this: By the end of the course, you’ll be capable of creating figures like this:\n\n\nby Cédric Scherer\n\n\n1.2.3 The Art of Data Wrangling\nIn our daily research, data is rarely neat. Before you can start analyzing, you’ll likely spend hours organizing it into a usable format. Fortunately, dplyr and tidyr simplify this process, turning data wrangling into a clear, logical workflow.\nTo get a quick taste, let us imagine describing your morning routine. In base R, it might look like a convoluted nest of functions:\n\neat(dressed(shower(brush(wakeup(you)))))\n\nOr, a series of perplexing intermediate variables:\n\nyou_w &lt;- wakeup(you)\nyou_bw &lt;- brush(you_w)\nyou_sbw &lt;- shower(you_bw)\n...\n\nWith dplyr, however, it transforms into a straightforward, logical flow:\n\nyou |&gt; \n  wakeup() |&gt; \n  brush() |&gt; \n  shower() |&gt; \n  get_dressed() |&gt; \n  eat() \n\nIn the tidyverse ecosystem, each step of data manipulation is easy to write and, more importantly, easy to follow when reading other people’s code. We’ll introduce you to a core set of verbs—fewer than ten—that will handle over 90% of everyday tasks. You see, coding languages are indeed simpler than human languages!\n\n1.2.4 Scientific typsetting\nYes, Microsoft Word is great. But when it comes to updating figures, managing references, or maintaining consistent layouts, it can quickly turn into a labyrinthine headache. The core issue is that Word is a WYSIWYG editor—What You See Is What You Get (a weird acronym, I know).\nThe problem with WYSIWYG editors is that they often require manual tweaks—nudging an image here, adjusting a margin there—which not only consumes valuable time but also opens the door to errors. This is why separating content from layout is a strategy worth adopting. Instead of wrestling with formatting, you focus on the substance of your work—the data, the analysis, the insights—and let the tools handle the presentation.\nWhile there are several tools for this purpose (including the notorious LaTeX), we’ll focus on Quarto, a modern document preparation system tailored for researchers. Quarto allows you to seamlessly integrate code, references, and figures, producing professional outputs in submission-ready formats like Word or LaTeX with minimal effort. By the end of this course, you’ll be able to generate documents like this with a single click in R:\n\n\nby LaPreprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Typesetting\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Quarto is powerful, sometimes you need specialized tools for optimal layout. LaTeX is one option, but it can feel outdated and cumbersome. We’ll briefly explore Typst, a modern alternative that offers the sophistication of LaTeX without the steep learning curve. It is also much faster and provided user-friendly interface for bebuggging. I firmlt believe Typst will replace LaTeX in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Reproducible Research\nAs a data editor for a journal, I’m often struck by how many papers are challenging to reproduce—which I see as a huge problem for science. In this course, you’ll learn to make your research fully reproducible, which benefits not only the scientific community but also you—it makes it easier to revisit and build upon your work.\n\n\nPhD comics by Jorge Cham\n\nWe’ll get into version control using Git and GitHub, tools that help you track changes, back up your work, and collaborate effectively. Additionally, we’ll cover specific techniques in R that support reproducible workflows, ensuring your research stands on a solid foundation.",

    "text": "1.4 What We Won’t Cover\nThere’s a vast universe of computing out there, and we have to draw the line somewhere (before we all get lost in a black hole of code). There’s a reason why programmers in the Silicon Valley are paid so well—computing is hard! Here are some intriguing areas we won’t cover in this course, but I encourage you to explore them in the future:\n\nAdvanced Statistics and Machine Learning: These areas are extensive and deserve dedicated courses. To dive deeper into the world of algorithms and data models, I’d recommend starting with Tidymodels, which shares the same design philosophy as the tidyverse and should make for a smooth transition.\nWriting R Packages: Creating your own R packages is super useful, but might be overkill for our current adventure. If you’re interested in trying this, check out Hadley Wickham’s book R Packages as a starting point.\nHigh-Performance Computing and Big Data Analytics: Working with massive datasets and supercomputers is exciting (who doesn’t want to feel like they’re in a NASA control room?), but it often requires specialized knowledge and environment-specific setups. Plus, ecological datasets aren’t usually large enough to make your laptop break a sweat. We’ll stick to tools that run on a standard machine. If you’re eager to unleash the Kraken of computing power, UCLA’s Hoffman2 Cluster has you covered with detailed guidelines.\nBuilding Personal Websites: Maintaining a professional personal website is important for academics—it’s like your digital business card. Quarto makes it quite easy to set one up, but we won’t cover the details in this course. If you’re intrested, I’d recommend exploring the Quarto documentation on making websites.\nOther Programming Languages: Python, Julia, and friends are like the enticing dessert menu after a big meal—tempting but perhaps best saved for another time. As mentioned earlier, transitioning from R to Julia is relatively straightforward, so you can always explore other languages when you’re ready to expand your coding palate.",

    "text": "2.2 Why Do We Need RStudio?\nThink of R as a high-performance engine—capable of incredible feats but not particularly user-friendly on its own. RStudio is the sleek vehicle that lets you harness that power efficiently. While you could interact with R through a basic terminal, RStudio’s interface smoothly handles the otherwise clunky commands and makes certain tasks—like visualizing results or managing code—remarkably more accessible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Options Worth Considering\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite RStudio’s popularity, it is hardly the only game in town. VSCode has emerged as a popular alternative—a versatile, general-purpose IDE that supports multiple programming languages. It’s well-designed, feature-rich, and, importantly, free and open-source. Personally, I use VSCode for most of my R programming work.\nAnother option on the horizon is Positron, developed by the same innovative team behind RStudio. It’s the modern evolution of RStudio, currently in beta but already showing great promise. It will eventually replace RStudio as the go-to IDE for R programming.\n\n\n\nRStudio is an incredible well-designed software that makes your life easier when working with R (and Python). It has a lot of features that make your life easier. We’ll explore many of these features as we progress, starting with making your R code look better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Your Code look prettier\n\n\n\nOne of the subtle joys of programming is crafting code that’s not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. To enhance the readability of your R scripts, consider installing the Fira Code font. Instruction can be found here and here.\nAnother way to make your code more readable is to format the codes according to the tidyverse style guide. Of course, no one wants to memorize all. Luckily, you can use the styler package to do this as an addin in RStudio (link).",

    "text": "2.3 Getting R to Work for You\nIn the grand tradition of programming tutorials, let’s start with the classic “Hello, World!”—a humble beginning to our journey with R.\n\n1print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n\n1\n\nThe print() function displays the text within on the console.\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"Hello, World!\"\n\n\nNext, you can use R as a straightforward calculator:\n\n3 + 2\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nYou can also store results in variables (so you can use them later):\n\n1x &lt;- 3 + 2\n2x\n\n\n1\n\nAssigns the value of 3 + 2 to the variable x.\n\n2\n\nThe x displays the value of x on the console.\n\n\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does R use &lt;-?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, &lt;- is for assignment while = is for function arguments. You can technically use = for assignment in almost all cases, meaning x &lt;- 3 + 2 is equivalent to x = 3 + 2. But then why does R continue to favor &lt;-?\nOne reason is conceptual clarity. In R, the distinction between assignment and function arguments is explicit, providing a cleaner syntax and helping avoid ambiguity in complex code. By differentiating assignment with &lt;-, R signals that an action is being performed, where data is transferred from one entity to another. This reinforces the principle that assignment and function arguments are inherently distinct constructs.\nA second reason is flexibility. R allows for the reverse assignment arrow, -&gt;, which lets you assign values in the opposite direction. For instance, 3 -&gt; x assigns the value 3 to x, a feature that can sometimes be handy.\nBut why don’t most other languages use a similar convention? One factor is typing efficiency: &lt;- requires three keystrokes, while = only requires one (although you eventually get used to it). However, there’s also a historical element here: early keyboards designed for statistical computing actually had a dedicated &lt;- key, which made the operator as convenient as = (source):\n\n\n\nFrom https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/data-structure-basics.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Exercise\n\nCreate a variable y and assign it the value of 5 * 3.

    "section": "2.5 Installing Packages",
    "text": "2.5 Installing Packages\n\n2.5.1 Standard approach\nTo unlock R’s full potential, you’ll often need to install additional packages—think of them as apps that extend your smartphone’s capabilities. This is a one-time process for each package on your computer. For example, to install the ggplot2 package:\n\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\nAfter that, simply load it when you need it:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Quirk to Watch Out For\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first design inconsistencies when using R: when installing a package, you enclose its name in quotes, but when loading it, you don’t. It’s a small quirk, but one that can trip you up if you’re not careful (speaking from experience :-(\nThere will be many others along the way. I will try to point them out as we go along.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot All Packages Are on CRAN\n\n\n\nNotably, not all packages are on CRAN. For example, many of them are on GitHub, GitLab, or other platforms. To install these packages, you can use the devtools package. For example, to install the ggthemr package from GitHub:\n\n1# install.packages(\"devtools\")\n2library(devtools)\n3devtools::install_github(\"cttobin/ggthemr\")\n\n\n1\n\nInstall the devtools package.\n\n2\n\nLoad the devtools package.\n\n3\n\nInstall the ggthemr package from GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 An alternative approach\nI prefer to use a different strategy. Consider using the pacman package. It automatically detects if the pointed package is installed and installs it if it’s not, and then load it. Here’s how you can use it:\n\n1# install.packages(\"pacman\")\n2library(pacman)\n3p_load(ggplot2)\n\n\n1\n\nKeep in mind that you’ll need to install pacman first, as it’s not part of R’s base packages.\n\n2\n\nLoad the pacman package.\n\n3\n\nUse p_load() to install and load the ggplot2 package in one go.\n\n\n\n\nThis can greatly simplify things when sharing code. You don’t have to wonder whether a particular library is installed on someone else’s system—p_load() handles it gracefully.\nBetter yet, for best practice, I strongly recommend the following command:\n\n1pacman::p_load(ggplot2)\n\n\n1\n\np_load() function is called from the pacman package\n\n\n\n\nWhat is this mysterious :: here? It simply means that we are loading the p_load() function from the pacman package. It allows you to access a function from a package without loading the entire package. This can help avoid conflicts with other packages that might have a similarly named function (which is a huge source for hidden errors!).\n\n\n2.5.3 Exercise: Installing Packages\nInstall the package gt using either the standard method or the pacman method.\n\nExerciseSolution\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

They are called ggplot2, tibble, and so on. We will get to know these in more detail throughout the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does conflicts message mean?\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the message, it shows what conflicts are there. The two conflicts are horrible design choices in tidyverse. Many mysterious bugs happen because of these conflicts. To avoid these, you can use the following code:\n\n1library(conflicted)\n2library(tidyverse)\n3conflict_prefer(\"filter\", \"dplyr\")\n4conflict_prefer(\"lag\", \"dplyr\")\n\n\n1\n\nLoad the conflicted package.\n\n2\n\nLoad the tidyverse package.\n\n3\n\nThis code says that if there is a conflict on filter, always prefer dplyr.\n\n4\n\nThis code says that if there is a conflict on lag, always prefer dplyr.\n\n\n\n\nAnother way is to just write your code using the package::funcion() format:\n\ndplyr::filter()\ndplyr::lag()\n\nGiven how often you’ll use these functions, I find it annoying with this approach. But it’s a personal choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to avoid the annoying messages?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not want to see the messages (although I do not recommend), you can use the suppressPackageStartupMessages() function. For example, you can use the following code to load the tidyverse package:\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\n\nThis approach hides the typical start-up output, though it remains entirely optional.\n\n\n\nWe’ll rely on the tidyverse extensively throughout this course.",

    "text": "3.1 Vector\nA data structure is an orderly, efficient way to store and retrieve data. While it may feel a bit abstract if you’re new to coding, think of these structures as the “nouns” in your programming language (with data wrangling serving as the “verbs”).\nR has provided many data structures. Fortunately, nine times out of ten, you’ll only need to worry about two: vector and tibble.\nA vector is a one-dimensional array—like a row of seats in a movie theater that only allows one type of audience member, be they numeric, character, or logical. We create them with the c() function. For example:\n1numbers &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n2numbers\n\n\n1\n\nCreate a vector of numbers from 1 to 5.\n\n2\n\nDisplay the numbers vector.\n\n\n\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\nVectors form the backbone of R scripts. They’re how you can store the number of penguins wandering around Antarctica, keep track of class attendance, or tally cars on the highway. A key detail: everything in a vector must share the same type. Some common types are:\nBelow, we make a few different vectors to illustrate these types:\n1numbers &lt;- c(1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5)\n2characters &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\n3logicals &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\n4factors &lt;- factor(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n\n\n1\n\nCreate a vector of numbers from 1 to 5.\n\n2\n\nCreate a vector of characters.\n\n3\n\nCreate a vector of logicals.\n\n4\n\nCreate a vector of factors.",

For example:\n\nclass(numbers) \n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nA horror story (not in R but in Excel) is that the auto-convert feature messes up gene names like SEPT4 to 4-Sept (datatype from character to datetime).

    "text": "3.2 Tibble\nA tibble (brought to you by the tidyverse) is essentially a set of vectors bound together in columns—like a multi-row, multi-column theater, where each column houses a single data type.\n\nAs a simple xample,\n\n1library(tidyverse)\n2tibble(\n3    x = c(1, 2, 3),\n4    y = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"),\n5    z = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\n6)\n\n\n1\n\nLoad the tidyverse package, as tibble is from it.\n\n2\n\nCreate a tibble.\n\n3\n\nCreate the first column as a vector of numbers from 1 to 3.\n\n4\n\nCreate the second column as a vector of characters.\n\n5\n\nCreate the third column as a vector of logicals.\n\n6\n\nAlways remember to close the function with a parenthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to write tibble\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is another equivalent way of writing it rowwisely.

You’ll notice each column explicitly labeled as dbl (double) or chr (character), which can save you from those frustrating mysteries where your numeric data gets disguised as text.\nTibbles also enforce a neat and consistent data layout, called Tidy Data, which is a godsend when you’re dealing with other people’s messy spreadsheets. Quoting from Hadley Wickham (link):\n\nTidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.\n\n\n\n\nFrom https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html\n\n\nWe will learn more about working with tibble more in the next sections, but for now, let’s move on to our example dataset.\n\n3.2.1 Exercise\nCreate a tibble with the following columns:\n\nname with your name and surname\nage with your age\nis_student with a logical value\n\n\nExerciseSolution\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",
