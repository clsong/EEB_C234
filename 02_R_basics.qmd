## Installing R and RStudio

::: {.callout-tip}
To make RStuido look better, you may want to install the fira font. Instruction can be found [here](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/RStudio-instructions) and [here](https://firacode.org/using-fira-code-ligatures-in-rstudio/).

Without Fira, you code could look like this: 
x <- 5  |> 
    sqrt() |> 
    round(2)

But with Firacode, it will look much better
```{r}
#| eval: false
x <- 5  |> 
    sqrt() |> 
    round(2)
```
