# Visualizing Distribution

::: {.callout-note}
## Class Objectives: Visualizing distribution
1. Distribution of a _single_ variable
2. Distribution of _multiple_ variables
3. Distribution of a variable across _multiple groups_
:::

Data distributions are central to data analysis. We'll explore several methods for visualizing distributions in R using ggplot2 and related packages. 

Let us begin by loading the necessary packages and setting the theme.
```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(tidylog)
library(palmerpenguins)
theme_set(theme_minimal()) #<1>
```
1. Set all plots to use `theme_minimal()`

## Single Variable

### Histograms

Histograms are a common way to visualize the distribution of a single variable. In this example, we plot the distribution of `flipper_length_mm` from the `penguins` dataset:

```{r}
#| warning: false
penguins |>
    ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
    geom_histogram(color = "white")
```

A frequent mistake is to call `geom_histogram()` without specifying the binwidth. When you don't set the bin width, ggplot2 uses a default value that may not reveal important details in your data. The example below shows how changing the bin width affects the histogram:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(patchwork)

c(1, 5, 20) %>%
    map(~ penguins |>
        ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
        geom_histogram(binwidth = ., color = "white")
    ) |>
    wrap_plots()
```


### Density Plots

Density plots provide a smooth estimate of the distribution. For example, the following code creates a density plot for `flipper_length_mm`:

```{r}
#| warning: false
penguins |>
    ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
    geom_density(fill = "lightblue")
```

A common pitfall is that the density curve may extend beyond the actual data range. To illustrate, if you normalize your data to range from 0 to 1, the density estimate might still spill outside these bounds. Consider the following example where we normalize the flipper lengths and then set explicit x-axis limits:

```{r}
#| warning: false
penguins |>
    drop_na(flipper_length_mm) |>
    mutate(flipper_length_mm_normalized = (flipper_length_mm - min(flipper_length_mm)) / (max(flipper_length_mm) - min(flipper_length_mm))) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm_normalized)) +
    geom_density(fill = "lightblue") +
    xlim(-.2, 1.2) # <1>
```
1. We set the x-axis limits to [-0.2, 1.2] to illustrate the issue.

Without careful inspection, you might not notice that the density extends outside the [0, 1] interval. To fix this, you can specify the bounds in `geom_density()`:

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| source-line-numbers: "6"
penguins |>
    drop_na(flipper_length_mm) |>
    mutate(flipper_length_mm_normalized = (flipper_length_mm - min(flipper_length_mm)) / (max(flipper_length_mm) - min(flipper_length_mm))) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm_normalized)) +
    geom_density(fill = "lightblue", 
                bounds = c(0, 1)) + # <1>
    xlim(-.2, 1.2)
```
1. We specify the bounds in `geom_density()` to ensure the density curve stays within the [0, 1] interval.

## Alternative density estimate
The `ggalt` package's `geom_bkde()` function can sometimes provide a better density estimate.

## Comparing More Than One Variable

### Histograms vs Density

As a general rule, DON'T use Histograms _naively_ when dealing with multiple variables. For example, all three examples below are difficult to efficiently compare the distribution of flipper length across different species.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Overlapping histograms
Each group is plotted in the same space with transparency:

```{r}
#| warning: false
penguins |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, group = species, fill = species)) +
    geom_histogram(color = "white", alpha = .5,position = "identity") +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
```

## Stacked Histograms

Histograms are stacked on top of each other to compare proportions:

```{r}
#| warning: false
penguins |>
    ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, group = species, fill = species)) +
    geom_histogram(color = "white", position = "stack") +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
```

## Side by side histograms

Histograms for each group are placed next to one another for easier comparison:

```{r}
#| warning: false
penguins |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, group = species, fill = species)) +
    geom_histogram(color = "white", position = "dodge") +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
```

:::

Density plots are generally easier to compare when multiple groups are involved. The following code overlays density curves for each species:

```{r}
#| warning: false
penguins |> 
    ggplot(aes(
        x = flipper_length_mm, 
        group = species, 
        fill = species, 
        color = species)) +
    geom_density(alpha = .5) +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
```

As we mentioned before, it is generally a good idea to avoid using legends. The library `geomtextpath` provides a way to add text to the density plot.

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(geomtextpath)

penguins |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, group = species, color = species)) +
    geom_textdensity(alpha = .5, aes(label = species), size = 5) +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
```

### Better Variations for Group Comparisons

There are many variations of density/histogram plots that are more informative and aesthetically pleasing. I particularly like two of them.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Separated plots

For datasets with more than two groups, faceting and highlighting each group can be very effective. We can easily do this with the `gghighlight` package:

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(gghighlight)

penguins |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
    geom_histogram(color = "white") +
    gghighlight() +
    facet_wrap(~species)
```

## Mirror density

When comparing two groups, a mirror density plot places one density curve above and one below the horizontal axis. This example compares male and female penguins:

```{r}
#| warning: false
penguins |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
    geom_density(
        data = filter(penguins, sex == "male"),
        aes(y = ..density..),
        alpha = .5, fill = "#69b3a2", color = "black") +
    geom_label( aes(x=180, y=0.02, label="male"), color="#69b3a2", size = 5) +
    geom_density(
        data = filter(penguins, sex == "female"),
        aes(y = -..density..),
        alpha = .5, fill = "#404080", color = "black") +
    geom_label( aes(x=228, y=-0.01, label="female"), color="#404080", size = 5)
```

## Many distributions at once

Sometimes, you need to display distributions for many groups simultaneously. For example, we use the `lincoln_weather` dataset (from the `ggridges` package) to demonstrate different approaches.

We first clean the data by selecting relevant columns and extracting the month from the date:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(ggridges)
lincoln_weather_clean <- lincoln_weather |>
    select(CST, `Mean Temperature [F]`) |>
    mutate(CST = ymd(CST)) |>
    mutate(month = month(CST, label = TRUE))
```

### Summarizing with Points and Error Bars

One approach is to show the mean along with an error bar. **Always be explicit about how you compute the error bar!** 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Confidence limit
```{r}
lincoln_weather_clean |>
    group_by(month) |>
    summarise(mean = mean(`Mean Temperature [F]`),
              lower = quantile(`Mean Temperature [F]`, 0.025),
              upper = quantile(`Mean Temperature [F]`, 0.975)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = month, y = mean, ymin = lower, ymax = upper)) +
    geom_pointrange()
```

## Standard deviation

```{r}
lincoln_weather_clean |>
    group_by(month) |>
    summarise(mean = mean(`Mean Temperature [F]`),
              sd = sd(`Mean Temperature [F]`)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = month, y = mean)) +
    geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = mean - sd, ymax = mean + sd))
```

## Standard error

```{r}
lincoln_weather_clean |>
    group_by(month) |>
    summarise(mean = mean(`Mean Temperature [F]`),
              se = sd(`Mean Temperature [F]`) / sqrt(n())) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = month, y = mean)) +
    geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se))
```

### Showing the Full Distribution

Whenever possible, display the full distribution rather than just summary statistics.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Boxplot

```{r}
#| warning: false
lincoln_weather_clean |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = month, y = `Mean Temperature [F]`)) +
    geom_boxplot() 
```

## Violin Plot

```{r}
#| warning: false
lincoln_weather_clean |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = month, y = `Mean Temperature [F]`)) +
    geom_violin() 
```

:::

It is generally advised to use violin plots instead of boxplots, especially when the data is not normally distributed (which is often the case). The animated comparison below illustrates why violin plots often convey more information than boxplots.

### Plotting the Actual Data Points

It's a good idea to show the raw data along with any summaries. This is especially true for real data, where we often have to work with limited samples. It is less useful, or sometimes even advised against, for synthetic data.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## DON't just use `geom_point()`
```{r}
lincoln_weather_clean |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = month, y = `Mean Temperature [F]`)) +
    geom_point(alpha = .5)
```

## Jittered points
Jittering helps avoid overlapping points:
```{r}
lincoln_weather_clean |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = month, y = `Mean Temperature [F]`)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = .5)
```

## Beeswarm style
For more controlled jittering, use the `ggbeeswarm` package:

```{r}
lincoln_weather_clean |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = month, y = `Mean Temperature [F]`)) +
    ggbeeswarm::geom_quasirandom(varwidth = TRUE) 
```
:::

Even better, why not show both the data and the distribution? 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Sina plot

```{r}
lincoln_weather_clean |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = month, y = `Mean Temperature [F]`)) +
    geom_violin(alpha = .5) +
    ggforce::geom_sina()
```

## Half-half plot

```{r}
lincoln_weather_clean |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = month, y = `Mean Temperature [F]`)) +
    gghalves::geom_half_violin(alpha = .5) +
    gghalves::geom_half_dotplot(method="histodot", stackdir="up", binwidth = 1)
```

### Ridge plot

Ridge plots (also known as joy plots) are great for comparing the distribution of a variable across many groups in a compact format. It provides a horizontal axis and a vertical density plot for each group.


```{r}
#| warning: false
library(ggridges)
lincoln_weather_clean |> 
    ggplot(aes(
        x = `Mean Temperature [F]`, 
        y = month, 
        fill = month, 
        color = month
    )) +
    geom_density_ridges(alpha = .5) +
    theme_ridges() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") 
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}
### Horizontal Plots

Horizon plots are an effective way to visualize time series data. It is extremely useful when you need to compare even more variables. You can use the `ggHoriPlot` package to create them. Check out the documentation [here](https://rivasiker.github.io/ggHoriPlot/articles/examples.html) for stunning examples.
