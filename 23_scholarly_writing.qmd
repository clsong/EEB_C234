## Why Quarto for Academic Writing?

Academic publishing requires precision, consistency, and proper attribution. Quarto excels in these areas by providing:

- **Reproducible research**: Code, analysis, and narratives in one document
- **Citation management**: Seamless integration with reference managers
- **Journal-specific formats**: Templates for various academic publishers
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Collaborate regardless of operating system
- **Multi-language support**: Use R, Python, Julia, or other languages as needed

## Setting Up for Academic Writing

For academic documents, your YAML header often needs more details:

```yaml
---
title: "Analysis of Penguin Morphology in the Antarctic Region"
author:
  - name: "Your Name"
    affiliation: "Your University"
    email: "your.email@university.edu"
    orcid: "0000-1234-5678-9101"
  - name: "Co-Author Name"
    affiliation: "Their University"
format: 
  pdf:
    documentclass: article
    classoption: [twocolumn, 11pt]
    toc: true
    number-sections: true
    cite-method: biblatex
bibliography: references.bib
csl: apa.csl
abstract: |
  This is the abstract of your paper. It should be concise and explain the main 
  findings of your work in about 150-250 words.
keywords: [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]
---
```

This header provides complete metadata for academic publishing, including proper author information, citation style, and document formatting.

## Managing Citations in Quarto

### Setting Up Your Bibliography

The first step is to link your bibliography file in the YAML header:

```yaml
bibliography: references.bib
csl: journal-of-ecology.csl
```

- `bibliography`: Points to your BibTeX or CSL JSON file
- `csl`: (Optional) Specifies the Citation Style Language file

### Creating a BibTeX File

Your BibTeX file contains all your references in a structured format. Here's a sample:

```bibtex
@article{smith2023,
  author = {Smith, John and Johnson, Sarah},
  title = {Analysis of Antarctic Penguin Species Distribution},
  journal = {Journal of Antarctic Biology},
  volume = {45},
  number = {2},
  pages = {112-128},
  year = {2023},
  doi = {10.1234/jab.2023.45.2.112}
}

@book{wilson2020,
  author = {Wilson, Maria},
  title = {Ecological Methodologies in Polar Regions},
  publisher = {Cambridge Academic Press},
  year = {2020},
  isbn = {978-3-16-148410-0}
}
```

### Citing Sources in Your Text

Once your bibliography is set up, citing sources is straightforward:

```markdown
According to @smith2023, penguin populations have declined in recent years.

Multiple studies [@smith2023; @wilson2020] have documented this trend.

As Wilson noted [-@wilson2020], methodology is critical in polar research.
```

These render as:

"According to Smith and Johnson (2023), penguin populations have declined in recent years."

"Multiple studies (Smith and Johnson, 2023; Wilson, 2020) have documented this trend."

"As Wilson noted (2020), methodology is critical in polar research."

## Advanced Equation Support

Academic papers often require complex mathematical notation. Quarto uses LaTeX syntax for equations:

### Inline Equations

For inline equations, use single dollar signs:

```markdown
The probability is given by $P(X > x) = \int_x^{\infty} f(t) \, dt$
```

### Display Equations

For standalone equations, use double dollar signs:

```markdown
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
\end{align}
$$
```

## Cross-References in Academic Writing

Cross-references help readers navigate your document. Quarto makes this simple with labels and references:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Figures

```{r}
#| label: fig-penguins
#| fig-cap: "Bill dimensions of three penguin species"
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: true

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)", y = "Bill Depth (mm)")
```

You can then reference this figure: "As shown in @fig-penguins, the bill dimensions clearly differentiate species."

## Sections

You can reference sections using their headers:

```markdown
## Data Collection Methodology {#sec-methodology}

... content ...

As described in @sec-methodology, our approach controls for seasonal variation.
```


## Equation Numbering

For numbered equations you can reference later:

```markdown
$$
\begin{align}
E = mc^2 \tag{1}\label{eq-einstein}
\end{align}
$$

As shown in Equation @eq-einstein, energy and mass are equivalent.
```
