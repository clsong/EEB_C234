# Grammar of Graphics
We will use a dataset called `penguins` from the `palmerpenguins` package. We will use this dataset throughout our course. This dataset contains measurements of penguins collected from three species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

First things first, let us load the `penguins` dataset.
```{r}
# install.packages("palmerpenguins")   # <1>
library(palmerpenguins) # <2>
data(package = "palmerpenguins") # <3>
```
1. If you have not installed the `palmerpenguins` package, you can install it by uncommenting this line.
2. Load the `palmerpenguins` package.
3. Load the `penguins` dataset.

As a first rule, always, always take a look at your data.
```{r}
penguins # <1>
``` 
1. Display the `penguins` dataset.

The data format we are using is called `tibble`. It is a modern version of the `data.frame` in R. It is part of the `tidyverse` package. For most of your daily works, tibble is the only two formats (the other is vector) you need to know.

Then we quickly visualize the data using the `ggplot2` package. Suppose we want to see how the flipper length of penguins (encoded as `flipper_length_mm` in the dataset) is related to their body mass (encoded as `body_mass_g`).
```{r}
#| warning: false
library(ggplot2) # <1>
ggplot(
  data = penguins, # <2>
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g) # <3>
) + 
  geom_point() # <4>
```
1. Load the `ggplot2` package.
2. Specify the dataset used in the plot.
3. Define the aesthetics of the plot. Here, we map the flipper length to the x-axis and body mass to the y-axis.
4. Add a layer of points to the plot.

Of course, this is just the beginning. To give you a sense of how to visualize it better, this would be the goal:
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(ggiraph)
p <- penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point_interactive(aes(tooltip = species)) +
  geom_
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Flipper Length vs Body Mass of Penguins",
    x = "Flipper Length (mm)",
    y = "Body Mass (g)"
  )

girafe(
  ggobj = p
)
```
