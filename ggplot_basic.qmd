# Grammar of Graphics

We will use a dataset
```{r}
# install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)
data(package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The data format we are using is called `tibble`. It is a modern version of the `data.frame` in R. It is part of the `tidyverse` package. For most of your daily works, tibble is the only format you need to know.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
    geom_point(
        aes(
            color = species,
            shape = species
        ),
        size = 2
    ) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange", "darkorchid", "cyan4"))
```
