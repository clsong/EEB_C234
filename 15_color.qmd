# Choosing Colors

Effective use of color in data visualization is crucial for communicating your message clearly. However, color is inherently subjective—it varies by person, culture, and even across generations. While no single “perfect” color scheme exists, following some general guidelines can help you create more readable, appealing, and accessible graphics.

## What to consider?

As mentioned in Chapter 6, you can have a lot of fun with choosing color palettes (e.g., [MetBrewer](https://github.com/BlakeRMills/MetBrewer)). However, there are caveats you need to be aware of.

First thing, before selecting a color palette, determine the nature of the variable you want to display. In general, you can classify variables into three categories:

1. **Qualitative (discrete) variables**: Use distinct colors for each category.
2. **Continuous sequential variables**: For variables with an inherent order, choose a palette that represents a gradual change.
   - **Single Hue**: Same color but variations in lightness and saturation.
   - **Multi Hue**: Transitioning between hues to indicate progression.
3. **Continuous divergent variables**: Use two contrasting hues that meet in a neutral middle value. This is ideal when your data diverges around a critical midpoint (e.g., zero).

Additionally, whenever possible, always verify that your plot is color-blind friendly. Many modern palettes are designed to be distinguishable for viewers with common forms of color vision deficiency. It is a more nuanced topic, so I will not go into detail here. But if you are interested, you can read more [here](https://markusmeister.com/2021/07/26/figure-design-for-colorblind-readers-is-outdated/). 

## My Go-To Solution: The `colorspace` Package

Based on these considerations, my preferred tool is the [colorspace](https://colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org/index.html) package. It provides a unified and flexible interface to generate color palettes tailored to the type of data you are visualizing.


For example, consider the following code that uses colorspace to create a scatterplot of penguins data:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(colorspace)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins |>
    ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_fill_discrete_qualitative() +
    jtools::theme_nice()
```

The color scale function--`scale_color_discrete_qualitative()`--is part of the `colorspace` package. Its naming convention follows the structure:

```{r}
#| eval: false
scale_<aesthetic>_<datatype>_<colorscale>()
```

- `<aesthetic>`: The visual attribute (e.g., color or fill).
- `<datatype>`: The type of data (e.g., discrete for qualitative data).
- `<colorscale>`: The palette type (e.g., qualitative, sequential, diverging).

## DON'T use the rainbow color palette.

Although visually striking, rainbow palettes can distort data interpretation because the perception of colors is non-linear and may mislead the viewer.

## Use `viridis` package for continuous sequential variables.

Another popular package is `viridis` package, which offers excellent color palettes. As an example,

However, it is mainly optimized for continuous sequential variables and might not be as flexible as colorspace for all types of data.
